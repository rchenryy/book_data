It Ends with Us,Colleen Hoover,2021/11/28,10,"Reflection: it was a story about abuse and like all the emotions on the page merited a trigger warning…i think i’m reacting correctly by feeling overwhelmed with what i’ve just read. you know the idea of “why doesn’t the woman just leave” this book shows it all. we see the characters fall in love and it’s beautiful to see and then the first abusives incident happen and the guys is all apologetic “it was an accident” “it will never happen” and the limit is stretched farther and it happens again. the book shows all the inner turmoil of this woman. she hates this man, but she loves this man. and she has all these feelings about him and herself and they all over whelm her especially with reference to her parents who were also in an abusive relationship. All that to say i was not ready for what i just read, but i’m glad i read it. i thought the author did a phenomenal job getting the reader to see inside the mc head. i felt like i could sympathize despite never having an experience like that",digital,,9781471156274,read,2023/03/28,2021/11/28,1

You Deserve Each Other,Sarah Hogle,2021/12/07,4,"my thoughts: kinda got weird/mushy at the end and lasted a bit too long, overall not bad; i think they needed to hit the topic of second chances a bit more, but it was a sweet rom com read. there was a weird imbalance with the job status between the couple. i think that the romance failed to peek through at a moderate pace and ended up just gushing at the end in a way that is similar to seeing a couple smother each other in public, not very comfy",paperback,,9780593085424,read,2023/03/28,2021/12/07,1
The Upside of Falling,Alex Light,2021/12/23,9,reflection: Ahh i loved how this book incorporates feelings even if it’s not realistic for everyone.

Beach Read,Emily Henry,2021/12/26,9,reflection: Augustus Everett is my newest fictional crush to add with all the others.

In a Holidaze,Christina Lauren,2021/12/28,5,my thoughts: my only problem with this book is that the love interest wasn’t fully clear. i felt like if it were either brother she ended up with there would be forced feelings. overall it was definitely a cute rom com for the holidays. ,digital,,9781982123956,read,2023/03/28,2021/12/28,1
People We Meet on Vacation,Emily Henry,2021/12/29,7,"my thoughts: i really liked the formatting of this book. the prologue unknowingly introduces us to an important scene, and the chapters go back and forth between past and present in a way that’s very easy to follow. i love that there was a crossover from The Beach Read (same author)!! i was so excited that i immediately texted my friend lol. the main thing that i found frustrating was that the characters gave up so easily, like the big event that is mentioned isn’t that big/the fallout didn’t seem very logical. the ending was kind of confusing bc it happens very quickly in comparison to the pace of the rest of the book, and my heart stopped right before the last chapter. overall, i still really liked the book mainly because of the feeling i got and the fact that i kept thinking about it even though i had finished it. (i was trying to figure out why i didn’t feel fully satisfied, and i still don’t know lol. i’m thinking it was the fast ending)",digital,,B08FZNYQJC,read,2023/03/28,2021/12/29,1
The Secret Life of Bees,Sue Monk Kidd,2021/12/30,10,"my thoughts: i believe that this book will always have a special place in my heart. the characters, the feelings, and the circumstances are something that everyone can relate to in one way or another. i think it was beautifully written showing the balance of good and bad in the world with an emphasis on our ability to create family by choice. when i finished this book i needed a second to process what happened and i hope that feeling is mutual with other readers.

Second First Impressions,Sally Thorne,2021/12/31,5,"my thoughts: i definitely liked this book, and my main thing against it is that the characters aren’t people that i can’t fully relate to. i think that’s the main thing barring me from a a greater connection. but i really liked everything else about it!",digital,,9780062912817,read,2023/03/28,2021/12/31,1

Who Do You Love,Jennifer Weiner,2022/02/19,10,"ahhhh this book. so good. i can’t even form words right now. i can tell this book will be one that i can’t stop thinking about. the characters are so well written and most times i don’t like character driven books but this book truly illustrated these beautifully-broken people. we could see their highs and lows when they were together and not. their lives were so separate yet indivisible. i cried several times notably when mr. sills said things. I think i felt every emotion while reading. this story was truly incredible to see these characters navigate race, social status, feelings, loss, work, fame, love, divorce, so much!!! I literally feel like i’ve read a biography of two people in one book. i loved seeing these characters grow from that fateful meeting in the hospital to the lives that they made themselves.",digital,,9781451617832,read,2023/03/28,2022/02/19,1

Today Tonight Tomorrow,Rachel Lynn Solomon,2022/03/06,9,"yesssss this book. love love love. such a good ya, enemies to lovers book. i loved seeing the complexities of the characters and their transformation of each other. i felt like we got to know them by them getting to know each other and truly be the characters which was so cool. i really like seeing them connect through their experiences with antisemitism and the desperation to prove themselves. i absolute loved the love note in the yearbook and the bench motif (so subtle yet so powerful) my one criticism is how fast it feels (over just one day) but i think the context of loving each other for a while makes it feel not weird. ahhhh so good just a lot of fun and ofc love",digital,,9781534440265,read,2023/03/28,2022/03/06,1
This Time Next Year,Sophie Cousens,2022/03/13,9,i was so sad for this book to end. i loved all the little easter eggs thrown in and way that the characters were “fated” to be together. i loved seeing her find herself before committing to someone and i’m also a sucker for characters who like to serve others. i originally didn’t love the one part where is was super cliche but ended up liking what the author did with it. i’m glad we got to see some of the complexities of the characters and really understand their backgrounds from their families. my request is that i really wish there was an epilogue and more pov from quinn. overall so much fun love love love want to know what happens next!

The Bride Test,Helen Hoang,2022/03/21,9,"the word that stuck in my mind about this book was: captivating. the character growth in this book was *chefs kiss* i absolutely adored the characters how supportive the side characters were. one thing that i thought was curious, i wasn’t really able to tell when they spoke english vs. Vietnamese. this book definitely reinforced how much i really like multiple povs. the perspective from a guy with autism was really interesting to me. the whole emotional feeling of “i can’t love” was really effective in adding tension and character development. i was kinda surprised about the limited reaction to Esme’s daughter Jade but i’m glad it didn’t blow up the entire ending if if i wish she’d told them sooner. this was such a sweet, and a little spicy, book and a solid read",digital,,9780451490834,read,2023/03/28,2022/03/21,1

Faker,Sarah Smith,2022/03/25,6,"my thoughts: 7/10 not a bad read. i felt like the first half was a lot better than the second half. the brooding tension between the pair lasted for 30 percent of the book and then its an awkward mush with the big climax that felt weird to me. I like the characters’ backgrounds and seeing the ethnical representation, and i thought the romance was well written, especially the slow burn aspect. I just felt like their bickering and “hate” for each other could’ve been drawn out a slight bit longer. Overall the story wasn’t bad and i enjoyed reading it, but it didn’t really strike me in a certain way like past books have.",digital,Sarah Echavarre Smith,9781984805430,read,2023/03/28,2022/03/25,1
The Dating Plan,Sara Desai,2022/03/27,8,"Very much like the last one i loved the characters, i loved the side characters, i liked the plot and premise and it was overall very fun to read. i liked that this one felt complex but there weren’t too many storylines to keep straight like last time. spicy scenes were *clears throat* well written. i liked knowing daisy from the previous book (she was layla and sam’s receptionist) but i felt like both layla and daisy were much different from what i pictured in the last book. i felt like i could relate more to daisy than layla and i liked that Liam’s drive felt more multifaceted. definitely had a fun time reading!",digital,,9780593100592,read,2023/03/28,2022/03/27,1
The Marriage Game,Sara Desai,2022/03/27,8,"my thoughts: 9/10 this book was so much fun!!! the characters were multifaceted and the side characters were awesome. i loved seeing layla’s confidence grow and i loved seeing sam let go of his past. so much happened in this book i don’t even think i covered it all but it kept the story and plot rich and full. i loved seeing the tension between the two when they finally hit their breaking point of hating to love it was *chefs kiss* the spice was, ahem, very well written. the cultural aspect of family and tradition and just all of it was a super fun read. i loved the multiple povs (especially when the guys is obsessed, in a good way, with the girl) it’s just amazing. loved this book.",digital,,9780593100578,read,2023/03/28,2022/03/27,1
The Trouble with Hating You,Sajni Patel,2022/03/28,7,"my thoughts 8/10: this book is a thinker. the characters are so broken and flawed and we see their actions being decided by their past. but we also see them grow from being with each other and accepting that the past is going to be a part of who they are but does not have to define them. the cultural aspect of arranged marriage, along with abuse and loss was all so sorrowfully mixed together in this book. the pain and grief from both liya and jay made their relationship even more special. i loved liya be a role model of independence but i also liked seeing her lean back on her supports. i was super impressed at jay’s persistence ngl. i loved the banter and hate they had at the beginning and seeing it transform into a formidable bond. truly a wonderful read and very profound message of love.",digital,,9781538733356,read,2023/03/28,2022/03/28,1
"First Love, Take Two",Sajni Patel,2022/03/29,7,my thoughts 8/10: another thinker! i absolutely loved this book and all the complexities it brought to the surface. the depiction of anxiety through Patel’s words was flawless and almost too realistic. the barriers of race and tradition and family blocking love were so eye opening and profound. i think it truly tackled these subjects like no other book i’ve read has. i absolutely loved the crossover from the previous book and would recommend reading it before this one (there’d be a lot of missing content) i think i liked this one better tho because of how i could relate to the overwhelming and consuming anxiety preeti felt. i’m such a huge fan of daniel and their relationship. the perseverance and their love was so beautiful and perfectly matched. i was hoping for some spice but the heated moments had to suffice for now (which i think was appropriate given the gravity of some of the topics) overall very thought provoking and i don’t think fun is the right word but i enjoyed reading this book even though it’s emotionally jarring.,digital,,9781538733387,read,2023/03/28,2022/03/29,1
The Soulmate Equation,Christina Lauren,2022/03/31,10,"my thoughts: 10/10 I loved this book so much. it was so much fun to read and the light hearted was was a perfect mood booster from the past few books. I am newly obsessed with River, he is absolutely adorable. i love juno and was glad that having a child didn’t take away from the story or the relationship. the ending proposal location felt so obvious to me and i was kinda mad at river for not figuring it out sooner but i love how it all ended. i will admit i wasn’t sure how they were going to add tension to a climax in the book and i would say that it was perfect intensity for the plot. (i kinda felt weird about river not saying anything for over a week, maybe only 5 days…idk but yeah) i loved how loving and supportive all the supporting characters were. there wasn’t an overwhelming number of awful people in their lives which made this story more pleasant and lighter which was much needed!! anyway, overall really good read (loved the spicy scenes they were..pretty good…) definitely would recommend!

You Don't Live Here,Robyn Schneider,2022/04/01,7,"my thoughts 8/10: I thought that this book was extremely powerful. I’d really love if it became a classic that’s read in schools. I have loved past books by Robyn Schneider, and she never fails to blow me away with a thought provoking story. Although I don’t relate to Sasha, I feel like her story is a lot more common than people think and one worth sharing. I really appreciated reading and learning and seeing the life of someone who is bi through this lens. I leave a lot out in the synopsis, but i think that the story truly speaks for itself. highly recommend YA",digital,,9780062568144,read,2023/03/28,2022/04/01,1
The Wedding Date,Jasmine Guillory,2022/04/01,7,"my thoughts: 8/10 I ended up really liking this book! The climax was frustrating, but i think the beginning and end of the book make it worth it. i was really mad at the characters for being stupid at some points specifically all the assuming instead of just talking about it. ughhhhh!! i liked how cute they were and unashamed they were to be intimate (wished the scenes had been more graphic). i liked that race and gender were considered (although there were a few questionable moments) overall it was super fun and quick read!",digital,,9780399587672,read,2023/03/28,2022/04/01,1
Where the Crawdads Sing,Delia Owens,2022/04/09,7,"i feel so conflicted…i’m even sure what to write. i guess i’m pleased, but i still feel dissatisfied. nothing that comes to mind is coherent so i’ll leave my thoughts as conflicted but pleased. I really enjoyed the book, although i’m not sophisticated enough to appreciate all the imagery that owens used. i thought the complexity of Kya’s character was extremely well developed and i also liked hearing snippet of others’ povs. i liked the plot even though it left me confused. i don’t feel able to give it a high rating bc i don’t feel happy?",digital,,9780735219113,read,2023/03/28,2022/04/09,1
The Heart Principle,Helen Hoang,2022/04/12,7,"i liked this book. my main concern was how the characters made up…like i know the whole point was that she was able to be very vulnerable with him, but it felt weird..I also was really pissed at her family for being so unaccepting and insensitive. i love Quan, he’s so sweet and i’m so glad he got his happy ending finally. I really wish there was more of a crossover with this book and the bride test but I appreciated the crossover with the kiss quotient. I think it would’ve been really interesting to have the characters who have autism talk about and relate to one another. I really felt like I could relate to how Anna felt about perfectionism maybe not to the same intensity that she had it but I love to seeing her overcome that and stop trying to please people at every waking moment. I like seeing her come to accept herself the way that she is and seeing that support from Quan (he really is a sweetheart) I had fun with this one but I still think that I prefer the Bride Test.",digital,,9781838950811,read,2023/03/28,2022/04/12,1
Dating by the Book,Mary Ann Marlowe,2022/05/13,2,"This book took me way too long to finish, and I hate the mc. Ughhhh I felt that she was manipulative. While i can understand the argument that she was hurting or just learning, she is completely blind to social cues and doesn’t seem to care about people until they’re gone. Spoiler Section: She had like four different guys who liked her and she basically rejected all of them. Max being Silver fox sucks bc we never find out what happens to Charlie, like he literally stops existing. My very first inclination was TeamMax, but he was kinda controlling (but also he pours his heart to her and she’s like no) but also I like Charlie and wanted him to be Silver Fox.

Like Fox has this deep rooted issues but these issues aren’t given the exposition needed for the reader to understand why he should overcome them. Also i was just kinda pissed that they couldn’t just be honest and be like “i’m so in love with you” but plot ig. i have to give the characters some credit bc they really are adorable together and there was some substance for example the idea of being forced into a stereotype and trying to break it and also finding confidence to be the main character but uhh yeah some of the characters actions confused me lol.,digital,,9780063045705,read,2023/03/28,2022/07/27,1

Shipped,Angie Hockman,2022/11/29,8,"shipped: so much fun, so cute. Loved the enemies to lovers, and the combination between the unhoneymooners and the hating game. i loved the feminism and there wasn’t really a third act breakup (i felt like the conflict wasn’t the relationship). i’d consider ya but there were some heated moments.

Love at First Spite,Anna E. Collins,2022/12/02,6,"not gonna lie I was a little disappointed by this book. I didn’t like the third act conflict. I didn’t like the reasoning that was given for the conflict. I didn’t like the mc guy because he was so disinterested and his reasoning, for being distant was stupid. however, the first bit of the story was enjoyable until about the 45% mark.

I ended up not minding the characters in the end (they weren’t my fav to begin with) but i can appreciate the social anxiety relatability and no third act break up. i think the mc was a little too quirky for me with her “head in the clouds” fantasy land personality but it was better than the other one in my opinion!,digital,,9780593085547,read,2023/03/28,2022/12/09,1

The Meeting Point,Olivia Lara,2022/12/22,8,I actually really enjoyed the serendipity in this book! Although the fmc was a little stupid and the mmc was a little goofy.

I thought they way they originally handled the relationship with transparency was refreshing but the juvenile immaturity of keeping a document from high school wasn’t cute (like at that point cmon it’s laughable).

Why the hell did the (not) brother have so much input??? Although I think that Blaise hit the mark with the “do you not trust me enough to tell me” part.

To Make Matters Worse,Elle Rivers,2023/08/10,5,It got better but like ehhh. The best friends were annoying with the whole ticking time bomb stuff. I felt like there were a lot of managed emotions and stuff which was just frustrating to read. I did like that they got better with communicating with one another but apart from the main relationship everyone else was annoying.,digital,,B0BCZWC3QZ,read,2023/08/10,2023/08/10,1
All Downhill With You,Julie Olivia,2023/08/11,9,"Awwwwww. I loved this one!!? And! I can already anticipate the next three couples…;) it was so cute and totally what I expected and wanted from a cute rom com grumpyxsunshine/enemies to lovers.

The Fiction Between Us,Julie Olivia,2023/08/11,9,"This series is actually so cute!!!! I love the community, and I like that the characters aren’t annoying. With the reverse grumpyxsunshine and the friends to enemies to lovers it was *chef kiss* I think I’m also excited to see the seedlings of the other relationships from the next books. Overall I really dig this universe and I appreciate that the author doesn’t make it longer than it needs to be but also adds enough complexity to keep the story entertaining.",digital,,B0B94BBPM6,read,2023/08/11,2023/08/11,1
Their Freefall At Last,Julie Olivia,2023/08/12,9,Gah this book broke my heart and mended it back together. My one request was that instead of an engagement it was moving in together and instead of a wedding considering an engagement. I think the point could’ve gotten across without actually making it to the wedding day bc Ruby could’ve still encouraged Bennett to go after Jolene with a proposal. But that’s my op I think it’s just so frivolous and cliche to get all the way to the wedding day. HOWEVER this was such a good book. I loved the crumb trail from the previous books. I’m a sucker for a childhood romance (Who Do You Love??)))). Anyways it was so beautiful and fun to see their relationship start and grow and blossom and go into hibernation and then be re seeded and etc. They were actually soo cute and this series was came to such a happy conclusion for me. Overall very pleased,digital,,B0BTJDCTD9,read,2023/08/12,2023/08/12,1
Our Ride To Forever,Julie Olivia,2023/08/12,9,I feel like a broken record but this series is simply too cute. I wasn’t expecting the marriage of convenience but it’s not bad. I’m glad there wasn’t any real breakup and the confusion at the beginning was kinda fun. I like that she was able to help him and encourage him to adjust his life to help his health and that he helped validate her beyond being the “vacation friend” overall still loving the series,digital,,B0BMFHTRW3,read,2023/08/11,2023/08/12,1
Happy Place,Emily Henry,2023/08/15,10,"Emotionally wrecked. I would say that I wish that it didn’t seems like only Wyn’s fault at the beginning but now I kinda see it as metaphor for Harriet’s mindset being limited or in denial or not understanding the full picture. I loved how the tension grew and while I knew it was the cliche “I don’t want things to change,” I thought it was beautifully done. I also really like how everyone made mistakes and how it was clear that they took responsibility and learned not only from the mistake but also how to communicate better from learning. I loved the “happy place” motif and how she universally used the term. Overall it was so good and a perfect #100 for the year.",hardcover,,9780593441275,read,2023/07/10,2023/08/15,1

The Write Place,Allie Samberts,2023/08/23,7,Ehhh I wasn’t really feeling this book…maybe it’s my own mindset but I didn’t feel very invested in the characters (especially not in the end) the third act breakup was stupid and not for good reason and overall was meh.

You Can't Fight Molecular Attraction,Marceline Addams,2023/08/25,9,Wait this book was so good!!! I didn’t really have any critiques..?? Maybe a few more moments of the MMC and FMC together to see the relationship together like in stead of saying “they talked all the afternoon” giving a few more snippets of conversations and also maybe a few inside jokes for them.

In Too Deep,Julie Olivia,2023/08/27,8,Aww this was a cute story! Overall I don’t have any critiques but I always have the underlying dread with office romances bc I know something bad is probs coming. However it wasn’t too bad.

In His Eyes,Julie Olivia,2023/08/28,7,"Ehhh okay it was good but the third act disconnect (wasn’t really a break up) was actually so stupid. Like he didn’t even give her the benefit of the doubt. How could he know and love her for a decade but not give her the benefit of the doubt???? I get the whole trauma but at least let her say her piece and not just ignore her completely. ALSO, how did her emotions just switch from he’s a player to i wanna fork him…what??? Was it that he dealt with her brothers so kindly (which was another weird addition) overall I just feel weird about this book there were moments I liked but I just feel stunned and a bit frustrated. I think the whole “Saria and Ian getting into the car thing” should’ve been played up more than the fake driving least have been dealt with equally.

In The Wild,Julie Olivia,2023/08/29,8,"Okay yay! A good end to the series. I was a little wary at first bc of the previous book, but overall it all ended in a pleasing way.

Faking Ms. Right,Claire Kingsley,2023/09/01,9,YAYY!! Alright I knew what the third act break up would be about but I’m glad it didn’t last too long. And there’s the comfort of knowing what will happen. Obvi I wish that Shep hadn’t rushed to make a decision before fully hearing out Everly but I thought it was really cute how her friends advocated for her and got his head out of his ass.

Falling for My Enemy,Claire Kingsley,2023/09/02,9,"AHHHH this was so cute!! I loved the nerdy, quirky vibes. It was honestly adorable. I wasn’t a fan of the miscommunication trope but I wasn’t mad and I was pleased with how things resolved themselves.

Marrying Mr. Wrong,Claire Kingsley,2023/09/03,9,Another fun one! I gotta say one moment that really stuck out to me was when Cox had a moment of rash decision making and apologized for it. I really liked how that growth of communication was added into the story even it was a one step forward and three steps back. I loved that Sophie’s thing was clumsiness and that Cox just didn’t think marriage was for him (but that could’ve been hit harder).

Flirting With Forever,Claire Kingsley,2023/09/04,9,OMG wait that was so sweet. This entire series was a win for me. I was thinking to myself I hope that this third act breakup has to do with something that’s not like a last minute thing but rather an integral part of the character/plot and I felt like the someone using another’s name was perfect. I also really liked the formula of originally the friends getting the guys head our of his ass to the husbands getting the guy’s head out of his ass. I also really appreciated how good of a dad Dex is. SO glad it ended happily and the bonus epilogue was too cute!,digital,,B0BXBFG19R,read,2023/09/04,2023/09/04,1
West Side Love Story,Priscilla Oliveras,2023/09/09,7,I liked this one. I appreciated the nudges towards Romeo and Juliet even tho they weren’t subtle. I like the culture aspect and the value of family. I wanted more spice the slow burn was good but then it faded to black :( oh well.

Desserts for Stressed People,Letizia Lorini,2023/09/16,6,My biggest frustration with this book was that you can’t accuse someone of doing something bad and not confront them only to do the same thing to them.

I thought the plot was moving fast but I think it also allowed there to be moments for the characters to interact and create memories together. I really like the specific moments that authors put into their books so the Oreo story and the time that they spent together watching Marvel or eating cake made their relationship more believable and made you want to root for them.

I felt like they were both misunderstood or misinterpreted but were able to see each other in a really beautiful way.

I felt like a dual timeline would’ve been a good addition because I really loved the flashbacks. I also feel iffy with the whole second chance part and the pseudo stalking.

It ended happily but all that good was shadowed by one little bad and pissed me off. Like she cares about him right?

Spring Tide,Ki Stephens,2023/11/05,5,Bro this was so bad. What a struggle to get through. I loved the idea/premise but the execution was lacking. I hate when characters have personalities/attributes that we’re supposed to know but they don’t show it in their actions so I’m like midway through a book and it’s like “oh yeah and I’m insecure bc no one takes me seriously” as a major personality trait and I’m like where did that come from (OR! When they seem like they’re really confident and then all the sudden it’s like yeah that confidence was a lie but we didn’t want to tell you the reader that) anyways I like character development not character trait bingo. Another thing about how bad this book was that the whole third act break up and reconciliation happened in like 5 pages at the end of the book which was like….? Are they middle schoolers??

I liked seeing the depth of the characters learning to better communicate what they needed and how to express their love in a way that was properly received. Overall there were elements that I thought were really well done and then the second half of the book kinda went off the rails lol (like ah yes sex fixes your problems) but whatever I liked the ending and I was glad that they didn’t actually divorce I thought the sexual tension made the second chance better and more believable.

The whole stunt with her going in the car when he told her not to go (like I get it but it’s like she made the situation worse) and also the big indecision about taking care of her child it was just weird…the justification and explanation for the kid being moved around is just weird….anyways over just meh didn’t really WANT to read a mafia romance but it was alright ig; gotta get those bookmarks,digital,,,read,2023/11/12,2023/11/12,1

I felt like the no spice was appropriate (I still would’ve liked it seasoned) but overall I thought this was a really sweet book.

Forces of Nature,Elle Rivers,2023/11/14,7,This book started really strong and overall it wasn’t bad but the direction changed a lot without smooth transitions. I thought the first scene showing the rivalry was really strong and then the meeting ten years later was good but then transitions and aim got a little messy. I liked the characters for sure. I as the reader needed more time to be like okay now we’re in this setting or a little more backstory before throwing an important plot point at me.

On Cloud Nine,"Kels Stone, Denise Stone",2023/11/17,5,Gahh I had so much hope for this book but it just wasn’t it. I had hope in the beginning and it just wasn’t relatable. Misunderstood rich girl who can still raise enough money to be a business owner and negotiate million dollar deals is privilege and the lovey dovey mush was just too much. I want a small bit at the end when they’re all happy but the weird lines were just bad. I was okayish with the confrontation of the parents but then again it just was a train barreling down the side of a hill. And THEN everything gets resolved with the parents in like a page or two.

I didn’t live the adult one as much..I think there needed to be more moments in the present bc I get the whole you’re the only one I could ever love, but like you haven’t seen someone in 10 years and you break off a fiver year relationship no. Also she inadvertently blamed him for his father’s death….and he thought he had sex with her when really it was another girl…???

I wasn’t a fan of the manic pixie girl vibes or the potential for a double third act break up but I think I ended up liking the end.

Baggage Claim,Juliana Smith,2023/11/27,7,"Ok ok I really enjoyed the beginning and most of the middle. And then… :( overall it needed more relationship exposition of them liking each other, like she was feisty and then all the sudden decided “actually I really like him for no clear reason;” lying by omission is stupid, trying to justify cheating???? Suddenly all is fine and he goes to the airport??? Like she’s fine just being there??? Gahh I knew how the outcome would be but trying to justify it????

I like the no third act break up, liked the spice, and the talking through things. Also loved the little engagement mismatch. I wish we had more background on why she left Isaac it felt like it came out of nowhere the entire time (like hints would’ve been good) what mostly annoyed me was that the families didn’t even try to be kind to the s/o like what the heck do people really act mean like that??? Idk I guess the protectiveness is nice but still you hardly know the person and a level of politeness is courteous.

The Sister Between Us,Hailey Dickert,2023/12/11,8,WAIT THAT WAS SO GOOD. I felt like the second timeline felt rushed a little…just the picking up right where they left off didn’t make sense completely…but ehhh it’s fiction and they got to be happy. I liked that they all dealt with their grief and understood that space was the healthy thing to do. Ik it was supposed to be a plot twist but I ducking guessed the sister would die.

Return Policy,Hailey Dickert,2023/12/13,7,I’m so disappointed. There were good moments but the bad ones outweighed them. I thought the banter was good in the beginning but then everything was solved by sex and the FMC started to annoy me. So much shirt was in this book tho like why were her family members so judge before meeting him…he hadn’t met his own family until recently. And why was she so upset about him keeping things from her like maybe he just needed time. And why was the ex such a slimy mf. Someone was clearly not doing a good job keeping him away and why did the dad blame the bf when he was trying to do right by his gf.

Also what’s up with self published authors giving soooo much trauma to the characters…like developed their arcs without trauma or at least less anyways disappointed.

I’m not sure that a man like Tucker exists but please bring one like him in my life.

Did she sometimes jump to conclusions did I totally fall for the climax and think the third act breakup was warranted yes.

The Long Game,Elena Armas,2024/01/06,6,This was like starting at the top and slowly going downhill and it’s only went faster downhill the longer it went (gaining momentum or whatever).

She’s so beautiful but she such a pain or I can’t stop looking at her but no he starts out seeming like he genuinely dislikes her and then 180 is like ok I’m taking care of her 2) this third act break up was some of the biggest bs. Why did she go back to a franchise/people that clearly didn’t give a rats ass abt her. He didn’t LIE bc lying implies there was a false statement made but if no statement is made then it can’t be a lie it’s simply deception. 3) no kid is that smart 4) Ada got annoying.

I was less enraptured at this one (maybe readers fatigue or that I stayed up hella late on the one before) but I still feel like it tied almost all the loose ends. We see Katie as a master of all magics and the kingdom brought to balance AND we see her and Lowell (bc I’m a romance girlie at heart).

Garnet Flats,Devney Perry,2024/01/18,5,I am disappointed. Was on a good streak but I think Talia’s second chance romance deserved better. One I get Foster was manipulated but also idk if I could forgive. And we didn’t see moments of WHY they should be together just this innate connection bs. There were a few moments where they leaned on one another but it’s wasn’t enough. We needed flashbacks of them building the relationship not just oh I’m horny. Listen I love some good smut ok? but like it doesn’t win over a relationship communication does. Also he basically has a kid with her former bff (Vivienne) who is also cuckoo bc SHE wants Foster to lose a game bc her bf is in millions of debt. Like the bff made mistakes and has to pay for the consequences (I think Foster also made mistakes but at least made an effort to put it behind him) But Vivienne asks him to re-insert himself into it??? I really feel like Tally deserved so much better.

God I love when the characters aren’t too problematic like yess I absolutely want to read about you talking and working through your problems.

Jasper Vale,Devney Perry,2024/01/19,7,"OK this is so much better than the one before but still kinda meh. I really enjoyed the characters. I was kind of annoyed with the Eden family, mainly the parents. I think that Jasper had a point that her parents didn’t seem to show that they trusted Eloise and I wish that had been dealt with. I think the whole mom forcing her to hire an employee and not follow the same process and then to have that employee almost shoot Eloise was a major plot point and needed to be discussed for the parent-child relationship. I liked that Eloise and Jasper had a few tender moments together and that it kinda evolved from sex. Overall I enjoyed!",digital,,9781957376219,read,2024/01/20,2024/01/19,1

Crimson River,Devney Perry,2024/01/20,8,Gosh I liked it but it also felt unsatisfying. I liked the mystery and I liked the relationship. I liked how the third act break up played out (I feel icky about lying but idk I’m not them). The “Where’s my chair Blue?” internally sobbing. I didn’t feel as scared with this one.

They literally wouldn’t talk about the root of the issue of why they broke up the first time until it came to a bottleneck and they had a mini breakup a second time which somehow was so easily smoothed over and moved on from which makes it confusing why they didn’t get back together sooner. Also they never resolved the parents making her buy higher. Wasn’t a fan of the many words of lovey doveyness and I really think a dual timeline would’ve been fun. Honestly I was kinda bored. The beginning wasn’t bad with the feelings but then the whole limbo was like also a limbo of feels which was boring. It’s like they were trying to be unproblematic but we’re still problematic and boring on top of it; so many ways to say I was bored lol,digital,,B09RKR6XN1,read,2024/01/23,2024/01/22,1

Also bro was so dramatic in the third act break up it was comical. The main characters were too good of people in like a cringey way. Like wanting to help people yes it’s good but do it in small ways that make me believe you. The proposal in the epilogue was cute.

It was shorter but the enemies to lovers was beautifully played out with wit and banter and jokes and sass and just soooo good. The farm girl personality was balanced and while the kid sometimes said a few things that were too perceptive it was happy and fun there was sacrifice and growth and the slow burn. So good it was too short honestly and I’m mad that I had to wait this fucking long for it. Two fucking books to get to this magnificent, endearing story. I’m just glad I held out.

I loved the slow burn romance and I can only imagine how it’s all going to turn out. SPOILER: Sir is immortal????? So much to unpack. The dissecting and gore was eugh but the heroine was so determined and caring and so cool. Then the mystery undercurrent of people’s organs being taken???? So good.

I wasn’t really feeling the “will they won’t they” vibes with Jack and Hazel but whatever. I’m glad they got their happy ending. I’m still confused about the immortality stuff like….her head is still alive?? Does she eat?? I loved the plot twist with the princess both the being “sick” and also finding out who her true love is. I felt like there was less direction in this book than the first (mainly bc the first one was hazel wanting to be a surgeon and this one was her figuring out what she even wanted to do at this point) ehhh I tried something different and it’s not my thing,digital,,9781250861023,read,2024/02/01,2024/02/01,1
The Summer We Fell,Elizabeth O'Roark,2024/02/03,9,"Omg there was so much angst. Miss girl got manipulated by everyone except Luke. It was so complex and nuanced. The writing was very well done and the emotions were pouring over every page. I wish there wasn’t cheating, and I wish Danny had come to the realization that he was taking advantage of Juliet and diminishing her vitality but he was too much of an ego centric confused Christian boy. I’m glad Donna came to her senses tho. Also why was there no penance for the pastor that guy was a dick not only to Juliet but also his wife taking advantage of his family?? I want to criticize Juliet for letting people have power over her, but if you’re fed your entire life that you’re less than with unsafe people, then it makes sense why she would cling to something that felt stable. (Also that would be like blaming the victim so…) Anyway the moments with Juliet and Luke has so much tension and when it burst it was like an explosion in the best way.

I won’t lie I lose some investment near the end bc the plot wasn’t all that clear; I felt like actually killing Dacre was anti climatic and the last ditch effort to make the ending interesting with Roman being accused was also kinda dumb. But! the tension at the beginning with the letters and secrecy *chefs kiss* and when Roman and Iris see each other in person by chance and in secret…so good. Loved the little side love stories too.

Too Much,I.A. Dice,2024/02/12,3,Ok I have some thoughts these men are kinda toxic. Like needlessly berating the woman instead of being supportive.

Poor Cassidy was looking for some validation which she should look in herself, but instead trusts a jerk who repeatedly hurts her. Hmmmm what does that sound like? oh yeah a manipulative, toxic relationship. Logan is so hot and cold and unpredictable he says one thing, expects another, but then does something entirely different. He got better in the end when they established a relationship (when he actually defends her) but still he sucked most of the book and never seemed to really see her as a person and more as a dirty secret. Also the fucking assuming didn’t get any better. Logan assumed his brothers thought one thing, assumed that Cassidy wanted something, so much assuming that was wrong and hurtful. He also “picked his brothers first” when in reality he never even gave Cassidy a chance to explain herself—so much wrong with the book but the spice was angsty…but yeah overall kinda sucked.

I also gotta give credit for the world building and creativity. But now, WHAT THE fork WAS THAT. you’re telling me she had powers this entire time???? Why the fork were we hearing her sulk about being powerless and feeling sorry for herself when she also literally have two power rulers curled around her finger and could’ve used THEIR power. She WAS selfish even tho the person she should’ve been caring towards ended up being the villain but whatever. The fucking love triangle grates my nerves what the hell is going on there????

And then we have Oro who where did he come from?? And wasn’t he old?? Like he was dying so in my mind he’s fucking old bc I guess Isla and Oro love each other so they can use each other’s powers???? I feel like they deserve each other tho because they’re both kinda lame and they did spend actual time together but then I also think that maybe Oro deserves better??? I’m not sure. I think Grim deserves somewhat better tho. Yes the memory removal and yes not telling powers doesn’t make fucking sense but the other stuff was out of trying to protect her, was it misguided yes, did she really need to go love another man for it?? Was her love for Oro just payback for Grim’s betrayal???? Honestly I just don’t care enough to read the next one. It’s going to be a bad love triangle and honestly I just wanted a slow burn romance with a morally gray guy but no she goes for the powerful sun king. SHE HAS FUCKING HISTORY WITH GRIM.

She wouldn’t even tell them the truth about how her sister and ex cheated on her to “protect” their family when in reality she just didn’t trust their reaction.

To Con a Gentleman,Sarah Adams,2024/04/05,9,"Wait stop. That was so good. I loved that so much. I wish we had been able to see the fruit of Rose and Carver’s relationship change, but the story was so good. I really vibed with the regency era and there were so many cute/funny moments. Plus the con woman x noble man was actually such a good trope. I really enjoyed that Rose was such a strong protagonist. I liked seeing them learn to trust each other and become more vulnerable and also help each other mend old wounds.

To Catch A Suitor,Sarah Adams,2024/04/07,8,That was like so slow burn. But gahhhh I’m so upset. Why do authors think it’s cute that the wrong couple gets to the fucking wedding? It’s not. If the real couple were supposed to be together they would have already known wayyy beforehand and should’ve gotten their shirt together wayy beforehand. I’m actually so upset because this book was so good and filled with MOMENTS that were perfect and you could see the relationship and how they knew each other and it was beautiful but then the ending had to fucking ruin it. Like I’m good with calling off an engagement but a whole fucking wedding is leading someone on to a different level and imo not cool.

Also the third act breakup pitiful pathetic like girl don’t beg for a guy to choose you. And then to have him figure it out in five seconds several weeks later….and then she was happy to have him back like that *snap* idk it was bad but it wasn’t great.

I really was not expecting the plot twist and for that I give high marks. I wasn’t super clear on the whole owning movie rights thing but this story was infused with grief tragedy lies but also determination perseverances and love. Honestly I loved the characters.

Girl knows how to keep a grudge tho. Jack was definitely a man written by a woman, easygoing, not emotionally stilted, obviously super hot. But whatever there were parts of the book where I was like this is actually a reality tv show moment. But I liked that it didn’t take itself too seriously while also infusing some self love and mental health messages. I liked the characters and their banter and Glen’s sadism and revenge.

King of Sloth,Ana Huang,2024/05/01,9,"I actually kinda loved this. By far my favorite King of Sin book. I really liked Xavier’s and Sloane’s characters. I feel like we got to see them in one context and then see how they started to view each other differently. However my favorite part of it all was how honest it all was (well mostly). I felt like their communication, other than that third act temporary separation can’t really call it a break up since Xavier was persistent, was very transparent and I thought that was refreshing. They didn’t assume, they tried to be there for one another, they had humility when they made mistakes truly likable characters that you want to root for. There were a few moments where I was like hmmm I wish this was shown not told, but on the whole there are a lot of sweet moments that show the development of their relationship that weave together nicely.

The Déjà Glitch,Holly James,2024/05/04,7,Bro I liked this book except the main character. I thought that Gemma was privileged and obnoxious. Was she burned a couple of times? Yes. However didn’t Jack also have baggage? And did he act like an entitled prick? No. Ok I get that this story was about getting out of the loop and not just going through the motions of life. I would’ve like this book better had we been given say like 5 days of repeats and dual pov. I was so sick of Gemma’s whiny perspective and I wanted to hear Jack’s. I also don’t understand what got them out of the loop was it seriously the falling in love?? Or was it that they changed their careers/life courses?? I think this had such an opportunity but fell flat. I also had a hard time not comparing it to “The Map of Tiny Perfect Things” which I felt made more sense for a loop and the impact was better.,digital,,9780593471593,read,2024/05/04,2024/05/04,1

C’mon. Anyways was really confused me was all the freaking acronyms there were so many and I wasn’t quite sure what half of them were. Overall I enjoyed this story.

Funny Story,Emily Henry,2024/05/09,8,Ok ok i really liked this until a certain point like 75% of the way. The last quarter of the book was like new weird confusing drama that detracted from the beginning of the story. I thought Daphne was so relatable in her reading and awkward introverted ways. I loved Miles and his big heart. But what was that third act conflict?? Bc it isn’t that there’s a bad explanation it’s that there isn’t an explanation. I thought the dates were cute and the tension building was fun and it came to a precipice and crashed in a good way but then there was fall out that led to some random drama that didn’t make sense and could’ve been solved with a good conversation.,digital,,9780593441220,read,2024/05/10,2024/05/09,1

Also why did Jude pretend to care about mortal servants for like a few pages (but then the servant died but then she undies and is a merperson??) I didn’t hate the plot it wasn’t actually too bad to follow which is good but now Jude is just winging it which ehh…Honestly this book was well written I just don’t if I really cared for it.

To Have and to Hoax,Martha Waters,2024/05/27,5,Bro this book made me so mad. The main characters were annoying as shirt and the whole ducking plot is a series of miscommunication that could’ve been solved with a clear conversation. Even the side characters were saying “Just talk to one another” but no they pulled stupid pranks which were dumb in more ways than one. The real kicker is that it’s all James’s fault AS IF VIOLET HAS DONE NOTHING WRONG. Girl….how you be expecting him to read your mind?? How did you think that faking an illness would make you feel better?? Like her “pranks” were actually so obvious it was insulting his intelligence.

I didn’t feel like there were moments together that felt fluid. Like the whole point of arranged marriage is that they secretly like one another and especially since they’d been friends prior one would think that the author would make their affection more apparent. But while they were denying how they feel I was feeling like yeah I believe that you don’t love them. Ok ok but they shouldn’t have teased the friendship in prior books if they come to the marriage hardly as friends. AND my biggest problem is that Julian was constantly dismissing Emily’s ideas.

Gotta love the BIPOC representation tho!! I like how devoted they were the entire book but there were parts that felt mushy that just made me jealous and sad (I want a bf who buys me books and cuddles).

I felt for Wes and his parents divorce but Nora just felt like white pretty privilege oh no I’m not going to be an actress. Which statistically speaking “making it” is very improbable.

The slow burn was awesome; the dual pov, dual timelines worked REALLY well. I’m so tempted to give a ten but that third act conflict really upset me. I loved the characters’ banter and moments. I liked seeing Adam go with Rachel to visit her dad.

Where the slow burn? The book tries so hard to be deep and meaningful but just comes off wrong. He calls her so many different nicknames, the plot was choppy and doesn’t have smooth transitions, and there wasn’t enough exposition. I really thinks dual timeline would’ve helped the story. Like a timeline of them as children/rivals up to the point of not talking and also the timeline we saw. Plus it had so much mush. Like when it’s mushy it feels like the author was lazy and thought that comparisons to nature counted as plot…plot twist it DOESNT it’s boring and now you’ve overused how meaningful other compliments are. Also when I talk about anxiety I joke like “hahaha I’m anxious” not “my life is so hard bc of anxiety” like if the message is life is difficult with anxiety then SHOW me through the character’s experience don’t have them tell me their thoughts like…ya know??

I don’t like the semi love triangle vibes with Bree, Nick and Sel but I hope that’s quashed quickly. I think the book’s theme of heritage and from where you came is thought provoking. About to make it about myself—but Bree’s heritage and family history was taken from her by a curse and she wants to know more/always had an underlying curiosity and reverence for it; I find that I feel rejected by my heritage and it makes me disinterested to know more.

Kinda forgot to resolve the brother issues and finally have the sit down where the older brothers recognize that Linc has matured and is ready to settle down. Also why was Linc’s mom so mean….that was just like cuts drama for the end?? But then Linc was lowkey really mean to her for being mean. You don’t tell your mom “You’re being a bitch” if you’re a grown 32 year old man you tell her “that was uncalled for” “that was inappropriate” “you were disrespectful” but ig grief and trauma which also should’ve been resolved with the family. I feel like the Salingers when I read them are fine but Myles particularly stirred the pot in this one unnecessarily and was just a duck.

Who knows why there’s a random Nick pov? Who knows the random new characters that don’t have any real relevancy in the book?? Then don’t even get me started on how annoying Nina is. She’s is clearly privileged and yes she has some family drama and her mom sucks, but she refuses to hear people out and her relationships with everyone is hot and cold. “My brother and I never got along” to “as long as my brother and father approve of my bf” like what??? Or “I only really knew her bc she was dating my brother” to “she’s one of my closest friends.” Or “my best friend Elizabeth” but not her maid of honor and kinda salty about it??? And the most infuriating relationship is Nina and Nick. There was so many opportunities to have moments between them that were missed. “We went for a hike and had some good conversation” should be a scene that’s written out and developed. Readers want to see the dialogue and the inside moments of these charactes’ relationship. And she’s all like “I love Nick” but then won’t hear him out?? Also the very premise of the book felt like it was missing something. Nina asks Nick to do the fake dating, he says no, then the next page is them packing their bags on a private jet to do the fake dating??? There’s just so much missing from this book like clearly marking when there’s a flashback to clearly marking who’s talking and overall the characters are inconsistent and annoying. Okay part two. I have no reason to root for Nina and Nick they hardly interact in the book. And then Nina’s random relationship that was maybe illegal bc she was a minor pops up out of nowhere?? And her father dies? There was just so many events in this book and not enough details about those events. I want the scene of Nina and Nick running together and them bantering. I don’t want “we came back from a run out of breath from laughing.” The storyline like 45% through stopped making any sense. Her mom was fucking her ex boyfriend (that ex boyfriend had also cheated on Nina with Nina’s ex best friend). Everyone was trying to convince Nina and Nick to be together but they were against it but then Nina was upset when he wouldn’t show up for her?? All of it was a mess and made me mad.",digital,,9798987986806,read,2024/08/27,2024/08/25,1
Wings of Stars,"M. Sinclair, R.L. Caulder",2024/08/28,6,"So, like I really wanted to like this one, however polygamy/polyamory is not for me. I think the world that was created was really interesting and I thought that Kieran was only slightly annoying/pick-me but you do really need like four or five guys all pining for her? And the wyvern turned into a man who also is pining after her? I think the prophecy and her unlocking her powers was a really good plot line, but there should only have been one love interest. Then she could have a bunch of other allies that are super cool in their own right but like not every side character’s sole purpose is to be a love interest. Also, there’s no reason for you to root for any of the couples except for maybe Ronan and Gabe. But Bastian was just kind of infatuated with Kieran and I guess there’s some sort of fated mates situation with Steele and the whole prophecy but they don’t like each other either. I just think I wasn’t the target audience for this book.",digital,,B0CPKDMLNF,read,2024/08/30,2024/08/28,1
The Game Changer,Lana Ferguson,2024/08/29,9,"Awwwww Lana Ferguson has yet to disappoint. And I think we share some of the same links but that’s beside the point. This is the standard romance novel I enjoy to read. Some fake dating, a sprinkle of hockey, brother’s best friend, no third act break up. The third act conflict was interesting but I think it worked. I loved that Delilah and Ian got their childhood friends to lovers moment. The banter and jokes were great just an overall solid rom com",digital,,9780593816844,read,2024/08/30,2024/08/29,1
Creatures That Breathe,M.L. Chambers,2024/08/31,8,I’m not really sure what the fork just happened but I had fun. Like the first one hundred pages could’ve been its own book. But then I think things started to make sense and the plot became more directed and clear. All the hot and cold between Cross and Leni was kinda confusing at the beginning and I really wish there had been a resolution to Leni losing her memories but overall it was fun wild crazy ride.,digital,,B0CYTTDCQ4,read,2024/08/31,2024/08/31,1
Conversations with Friends,Sally Rooney,2024/09/01,5,Only good thing about this book was that it had a yellow cover. Ok I hated it. I liked it? Idk. So I was able to grasp some of the depth. Like not using quotations probably elevated some of the “which is dialogue and which is thought” thinking which is relevant to the title being Conversations with Friends. And I definitely think at the characters were complex but I didn’t like any of them. Nick was using Frances and a cheater. Frances was self destructive and seemingly failed to connect with other people and didn’t even feel like a main or real character until the end bc she was so passive in book. Like she was observant sure but often she wouldn’t actually say shirt. Melissa was a bitch who cheated on her husband while he was in a psychiatric hospital and then got upset when he cheated on her back when they weren’t really in a true marriage (but she was more mad at Frances who ig helped Nick be a better husband in the first place). Bobbi kept abandoning her best friend (not that Frances made it easy to stay) but none of these characters are good people. Ok ok and I get that no one can be perfectly moral or good but that doesn’t mean that you should act like morality doesn’t matter. They were all pretentious in their idiotic conversations about philosophy and other champagne problems but also SO privileged. Regardless of the circumstances why not TRY to be a good person it doesn’t seem like it should be hard. Make mistakes but learn and change your behavior. And the book doesn’t have any real resolution. Like Nick is probably going to back to cheating on Melissa with Frances. Frances will be upset he’s married. Melissa will be mad that she’s being replaced by a twenty one year old. Bobbi will be mad at Frances for something. Frances will be lowkey dying/dealing with her chronic pain but not doing anything to get help. And this book tries soooo hard to be an AP Lit book. Like I just feel it being on the booklist in 2045. Thought provoking and upsetting.,paperback,,9780451499066,read,2024/09/01,2024/09/01,1

Like she goes to Ryder’s father and asked him to invest in a modeling business??? After you just broke his sons heart??? Idk man.

Like yes you’re scared of commitment like every other fucking person on this planet but that doesn’t give you the right to judge a person, or fork them and tell them to leave in the morning, or consistently call them cocky or egotistical when they need money and being charming is the way to get tips, like I really didn’t see any redeemable characteristics to her. She tells him to go and then he goes after asking her if she will talk about how she’s feeling (she refuses) but then she freaks out about him rejecting her. She dismisses his feelings as if they don’t matter or as if he doesn’t actually feel them, and then she has the audacity to feel lied to when he decides to not tell her intimate parts of his life that were probably painful.

Like girly pop Harriet planned your whole wedding, you’ve made fun of her throughout the book despite her help, and now you ask her “what’s wrong with you” do you know how shame coded that is? Honestly a lot of the friends seems like they were stirring up drama for no reason but whatever. Also why was Mel at the wedding?

Also someone needs to explain Chaol to me because wtf. I really should’ve done the tandem read. I also really would’ve preferred to have more intros on Yrene and Sartaq like we did for Manon and Aedion. Uhhhhh yeah I’m told the last one goes quick so excited for that.

To stay and rule? Why not find a nice little human home to camp out? Why be unnecessarily cruel? Is it the hurt people hurt people thing? Okay can we normalize having like heroines that are not teenagers?? Why is Aelin not even twenty?? Like she’s been tortured and maimed on several occasions and is still fine?? This was indeed a good end to the series. I loved seeing all the plot lines merge. Where did the wolf tribe even come from? Honestly kinda started to dislike Yrene for being in love with Chaol…like Chaol? Really? He was basically useless this whole series. Which is honestly impressive to be useless for so long. Where did the little God strolling come into play? Like they were mad that Brannon broke his promise or that Elena changed the course of the promise?? Why did they feel the need to re-kill Elena?? Like the gods motives and role came in and just didn’t make total sense or it felt out of left field. Honestly a lot of the vague war facts could’ve been cut down and I was skimming those pages anyway. Okay yeah I think those are all my thoughts. Maybe should’ve killed Chaol and somehow saved Yrene and the baby…might’ve liked him more if he self sacrificed.

I liked that Zoe and Aidan’s journey was about grief and forgiveness. Especially, forgiveness for yourself. While the premise was wack, I really liked reading their relationship develop from the cold resentment to the appreciation and affection. I don’t know I really dug this book.

He clearly saw the best in her and wanted her to be seen that way. Did he do the right thing by leaving? No. But this line “He wanted to take an ethical stance, even if it cost Daphne her career” is crazy. You would ask someone you care about to give up what they feel is right for your own personal gain? That’s called being selfish.

Rouge,Greer Rivers,2025/04/01,6,I wanted to like this one more than I did. It’s just that they hardly did anything together besides fuck. And like the mafia stuff was just okay. But she was justifying not being with him bc of her dad being in jail but her dad couldn’t give a rat’s ass about her and I don’t like the blind loyalty. Like her dad had her betrothed to an abuser wtf?? And she KEPT being like “we can’t be together yet bc I need to find more evidence to save my father” but girly pop was going crazy talking to elephants on the walls while he did all the scheming.

Playing Flirty,Shameez Patel,2025/04/06,8,Hehe I love when they’re meant to be. Okay but one thing really bothered me. Why the fork were we even considering the ex during the third act break up? Why did her mom and bff accept a man who subtly belittled her? Were they blind? Dumb? They’d already broken up why even let this happen. Now I know it’s probably ohh she needed to figure it out on her own but it felt like by them allowing it as a possibility she chose to consider it when he was lowkey a terrible person. Okay but otherwise this book was great. Loved all the nerdiness and the board games. Loved that they had already met. Loved that he’d been pining for her the entire time. Love that it was rivals to lovers. Loved the stolen moments and not so subtle flirting. Honestly it was great!,digital,,9781538768396,read,2025/04/24,2025/04/06,1

Ten Thousand Skies Above You,Claudia Gray,2025/09/03,10,"What the actual fuck. Ummm so the plot is working overtime. Paul goes after Conley to find a cure for Theo. So Conley splinters Paul, Marguerite goes after pieces of Paul’s soul…this causes her to question her love with Paul. There’s a Warverse, Medievalverse, One where Paul hurts her hand so she can’t art anymore, one where Paul is part of an organized crime family with his dad. But there’s this whole potential love triangle with Theo who doesn’t really stand a chance but for more suspense. But the whole backstory is that the original Triad includes Conley and her parents trying to bring back Josie who tried to leave her body at the moment she died and splintered. So they’re trying to destroy the multiverse to recollect her soul. And in like this one Marguerite is a bitch who enjoys meddling and fucking up her other lives. Oh and actually Conley and Josie are an item (in a lot of them) so that’s cute. But her parents are fucking psycho trying to bring Josie back… Side note OG Marguerite keeps ducking with her life in the Russiaverse (just leave yourself alone, you already got her preggo) but at least she feels remorse? So Anyways in the backstoryverse OG Marguerite plots with Paul and Theo in this dimension and they make a plan to use each others bodies in different dimensions to take down the triad. When Marguerite finally puts all the pieces of Paul back together he starts to believe that they are not destined for love but for pain (but lowkey they kinda synonymous in books like these) so he’s being all skeptical and she’s like let’s get home and regroup. Great right, clean slate going to take down the Triad in the last book? WRONG bitch Marguerite takes over her body using the bad green stuff that was killing Theo in the first one.

A Million Worlds with You,Claudia Gray,2025/09/04,10,"Yet another mindfuck. So evil Marguerite basically starts to build traps to kill OG Marguerite in other worlds. Basically trying to make her “perfect traveler” status moot. She runs to an Egypt verse, Londonverse, Romeverse (medievalverse), and basically gets all of those Marguerites killed and OG doesn’t really do much to help. Paul is fighting his demons from being splintered and has basically decided he and Marguerite are no good for one another. As evil Marge or Wicked as OG Marguerite dubs her (Berkeleyverse is OG) attempts to destroy dimensions and kill the Marguerites there, Paul is able to somehow combat the science and stabilize dimensions. Okay and spy Theo from Triadverse kills Egyptverse Marguerite (Berkleyverse hops out before dying) but he is somewhat redeemable bc he ends up sacrificing himself (he hated himself for killing Marguerite) to destroy Triadverse Conley (honestly the Home Office and Triadverse Conley’s are the main villains). Basically, the dimensions start working together and then they are ultimately able to defeat the Home Office verse that was trying to resurrect Josie. They were able to have a conference of Marguerites because one dimension made clones (the Cloneverse) which was great (Paul easily identified each Marguerite), there was also a dimension where Marguerite was deaf and her and Paul already had a baby (also super cute). Marguerite was able to convince her parents to stop the search for Josie (they’d named the project “Project Eurydice” and I just really love that for some reason). Her parents from home office decide to seal their dimension to atone and fix Conley’s trap to destroy all of the worlds (basically he built a fail safe to bring back Josie, but Berkeleyverse Marguerite destroys the body…too). Anyways Marguerite has nothing to lose bc Paul dies in the body of Home Office Paul so after returning home (she had taken over Wicked’s body without Wicked’s conscious in it). She jumps back into her body that wicked had taken over while she had taken over Wicked’s (it’s super complicated) so Wicked is doing bad stuff to Berkeleyverse Theo and Berkeleyverse Josie in Berkeleyverse Marguerite’s body and then jumps out (to not get trapped there? I think the nightthief drug was wearing off or she was just waiting for Berkeleyverse Marguerite to come back) and they try to think of a way to save the Home Office from exploding (sealing the dimension has a 40% chance of collapsing the dimension undoing everything including influencing other dimensions—basically undoing the whole fucking trilogy) but then Wicked comes back and tries to destroy Berkeleyverse for good and then I guess hops back into her dimension? Just to be sealed? Idk. So Berkeleyverse is about to be destroyed but plot twist Paul is not dead and he and Marguerite put their firebirds together to save the universe, declare their love for one another, and that’s kinda the end. So like it was somewhat anticlimactic in ways, but after that second book I don’t think it could be topped. Oh and the home office does not explode so the whole trilogy was not unraveled.

I just sometimes have a hard time when they are like from wealthy families and have privilege and don’t actually have anything wrong with their lives. Like I really wanna have sympathy for the stalker situation but at the same time I just feel like “oh my God I’m so sad that you’re a gorgeous model and that you have a billionaire boyfriend who’s fake who’s actually so in love with you anyways” in the end, the spice was fun",digital,,B0F3VWBPQ4,read,2025/10/02,2025/09/14,1
Beyond The Bell,Ana Kirk Shaw,2025/09/17,8,Honestly had a blast. Super duper messy principal and teacher??? but I thought it had good tension and plot and they were reasonably (could’ve been more) communicative but what can you do. Loved the side characters and the spice and the banter Oliver and Georgia were cute and entertaining dynamics,digital,,B0DQQ3XRBC,read,2025/10/02,2025/09/17,1
Teach Me A Lesson,Ana Kirk Shaw,2025/09/18,8,This was great. There was definitely a lot of spice but sue me I’m horny and scared of men. Uhhh Mia and Elias were cute love a good childhood friends to lovers the brother was ofc overbearing but whatever. The family was also depressing but whatever. Honestly it was spicy and had decent other plot. Can I really ask for more?,digital,,,read,2025/10/02,2025/09/18,1
Strictly Extracurricular,Ana Kirk Shaw,2025/09/21,7,This was fine. I liked how Lina and Dom were super honest and communicative until ofc the third act. And then when that hit it was kinda ehhh. Also this five year old is way to fucking smart (which was kinda the point but still) uhh I really liked it until the third act point bc they were so healthy and respectful and then it was like really dumb and mushy and like idk could’ve been avoided…if they had kept doing what they were doing before.,digital,,B0F5NGNVTF,read,2025/10/02,2025/09/21,1
Digging Dr Jones,Olivia Jackson,2025/09/24,6,Idk this was fine ig. It just feels like she’s incompetent and then has a few insights and then it brilliant. I wish it had been like an enemies to lovers where she was trying to compete with him and was acting dumb and then plot twist boom she’d been plotting the whole time!! But then they end up together kind of thing. Also weird that it’s Andrew and Adrianna….like why. Also I had Thor and Dr Jones playing in my head the entire time. Overall meh,digital,,9780008729646,read,2025/10/02,2025/09/24,1
Love Sick,Deidra Duncan,2025/09/27,8,"I didn’t hate it! Had fun, honestly though it very much a keep my head down and stay out of drama and that all sounded like a mess. But it gave some good plot and the characters were likable and fun. Julian honestly was such a sweetheart but it really pissed me off when he didn’t call Grace by her actual name but then it was better but I kinda wish he’d given her a nickname rather than using the name she explicitly said not to use felt like a boundary thing. Anyways it was still cute, solid read",digital,,9781529442106,read,2025/10/02,2025/09/27,1
A Forbidden Alchemy,Stacey McEwan,2025/10/01,9,"Honestly I have no idea what just happened…it was really good though. I want to know what happens next. It felt bad that she was lying to him the whole time. And ofc he’s butthurt about her lying (which rightfully so) and the waves of lies had each hit him until the last straw. I feel like I like Patrick a lot more than I like Nina, but also I’m wondering if it was actually Polly who betrayed them? I literally am so confused. I wish all the books were out",digital,,B0D4MKD7G7,read,2025/10/02,2025/10/01,1
Fall I Want,Lyra Parish,2025/10/05,5,Bad bad bad. The book could’ve ended at 50% and I’d still dislike it. then to make me read another 200 pages of nothing???,digital,,1961229455,read,2025/10/28,2025/10/05,1
Fall Too Well,Erin Branscom,2025/10/07,6,Marginally better but still bad. There was more actual plot but like then the antagonist gives up at the climax but then doesn’t like choose a storyline. They’re really cringy together in an icky way,digital,,B0DBWPFB7N,read,2025/10/28,2025/10/07,1
Swiped,Paula Rogers,2025/10/09,8,"Ehh this one was OK. I didn’t really feel like we got to see a lot of them interacting, which was unfortunate but the moments that they did were fun. I feel like there might’ve been some neurodivergent tendencies that were unaddressed but overall it was fine.",,,9781781899113,read,2025/10/28,2025/10/09,1
Give Me Butterflies,Jillian Meadows,2025/10/11,8,"Very solid read. Great communication, super healthy, definitely some healing, but the trust was there the communication was there the expectations were set from the beginning and explicitly told to one another. Overall this was pretty refreshing to read. Super fun, glad the children actually felt like kids.",digital,,,read,2025/10/28,2025/10/11,1

Witch Please,Ann Aguirre,2025/10/24,4,This was deeply bad. Didn’t like any of the side characters like at all. Then she doesn’t tell him she’s a witch? Like what???,digital,,9781728240176,read,2025/10/28,2025/10/24,1
The Paradise Problem,Christina Lauren,2025/10/28,8,"Okay not as bad as it could’ve been. The family was full of assholes but we knew that going in. Anna was eccentric, and West was kinda perfect but also not. Uhhh yeah it was fun and I read most of it in one sitting.",digital,,9781668017746,read,2025/10/28,2025/10/28,1
The Irresistible Urge to Fall For Your Enemy,Brigitte Knightley,2025/11/11,8,"Kinda loved. New world, definitely some fun moments. Solid read definitely see the Dramoine parallels. There’s a good amount of gore but I overall enjoyed. Good amount of build up and tension for the sequel. I hope we see more of the different orders.",digital,,9780593819470,read,2025/12/09,2025/11/11,1
Mistakes We Never Made,Hannah Brown,2025/11/13,8,"Hannah Alabama out here writing novels. And one that wasn’t bad! I’m impressed!! I was really worried that they were gonna put all of the blame on Emma, but I’m really glad that Finn and Sybil owned up to their lack of communication and straight up lying. I like that the characters were imperfect. I was surprised that they’re actually was depth in the book. Overall, it was a solid read.",digital,,B0CH7ZJZRQ,read,2025/12/09,2025/11/13,1
Mate,Ali Hazelwood,2025/11/17,9,"So I like smut, but that was a lot of smut. Honestly just silly goofy wolfy antics was there anything else to expect?? I had a fun time.

Night of the Witch,"Sara Raasch, Beth Revis",2025/11/23,7,"Wait a minute I finished another book! It was okay. Definitely picked up at the end. But I was also not that invested and could live not knowing what happens next. That might just be the burnout talking. Anyways, witches and witch hunters fantasy and history. It was a fun journey overall.",digital,,,read,2025/12/09,2025/11/23,1
The Bookshop of Secrets,Kerry Barrett,2025/12/09,9,"I fear I’m not one for wwii stories but this was a new perspective of sorts. I think it really picked up in the end, but it was a more steady slower paced start. I am really pissed that it’s a series…the slow romance was so good. I think once the espionage really picked up I was engaged. I think the second book will be more engaging because the exposition has already been set.",digital,,9780008603212,read,2025/12/09,2025/12/09,1
A Season for Second Chances,Jenny Bayliss,2025/12/11,8,Happy book one hundred!! This was sweet. Honestly more fiction than anything else and rather ordinary but in a good way.

The Man I Never Met,Elle Cook,2025/12/18,6,This kinda felt like the Tailor Swif video by ASAP Rocky. I thought I knew what was happening and then oh wait we have a cancer plot. I want to say it was good but it wasn’t. Like the initial romance..hard read…the dating the rebound for a year…so messy…and like we hardly saw them together. It felt like reading a summary instead of a plot. Anyways…,digital,,9780593500866,read,2026/01/01,2025/12/18,1
The Signature Move,Cassandra Diviak,2025/12/18,7,"This was kinda cute. It felt a little juvenile but overall it was fun. I mean they were young enough to have their whole personalities based on their sports, but I sped through it though!",digital,,9781960806048,read,2026/01/01,2025/12/18,1

The Tourist Attraction,Sarah Morgenthaler,2025/12/23,7,This started good and went downhill. Like there was a coherence/consistency issue. It felt very much like mixed signals the whole time which was very confusing to read.,digital,,9781492693116,read,2022/12/07,2025/12/23,1
Faking Under the Mistletoe,Ashley Shepherd,2025/12/25,6,This was fine. I didn’t read too deeply to be quite frank. I found the FMC irritating but I ended up being okay with the story and its ending. I just felt like this was a series of miscommunication and just avoidance. Not cute. Also no real spice boo,digital,,B07YL8L7MK,read,2026/01/01,2025/12/25,1
Heartless Hunter,Kristen Ciccarelli,2025/12/27,9,This was really good. I was super into the suspense and my heart was in my chest the whole time. The author did an excellent job of putting the characters in difficult situations (climbing a tree then setting it on fire) the one love scene was really icky to me bc they both were using each other but like overall I really loved this book,digital,,B0C1X64T4N,read,2026/01/01,2025/12/27,1
Rebel Witch,Kristen Ciccarelli,2025/12/28,10,"What a fucking ending. I really liked this duology. It was gripping heart breaking.

Wallflower in Bloom,Elise Kennedy,2025/12/29,7,Okay I liked this one alright. I just got tired of Violet needing validation from others about her looks and appearances.
