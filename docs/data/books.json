Okay let’s start off with the positives bc there’s only a few. I’ll give the author the good plot twist/kinda climax I liked that Celeste turned on Isla and that we find out the true nature bc honestly I was confused the whole time abt what the hell was happening. I also gotta give credit for the world building and creativity. But now, WHAT THE fork WAS THAT. you’re telling me she had powers this entire time???? Why the fork were we hearing her sulk about being powerless and feeling sorry for herself when she also literally have two power rulers curled around her finger and could’ve used THEIR power. She WAS selfish even tho the person she should’ve been caring towards ended up being the villain but whatever. The fucking love triangle grates my nerves what the hell is going on there???? She had a whole fucking relationship with Grim??? And he took her memories why??? And he didn’t tell her she had powers why??? And he was in love with her too??? And then we have Oro who where did he come from?? And wasn’t he old?? Like he was dying so in my mind he’s fucking old bc I guess Isla and Oro love each other so they can use each other’s powers???? I feel like they deserve each other tho because they’re both kinda lame and they did spend actual time together but then I also think that maybe Oro deserves better??? I’m not sure. I think Grim deserves somewhat better tho. Yes the memory removal and yes not telling powers doesn’t make fucking sense but the other stuff was out of trying to protect her, was it misguided yes, did she really need to go love another man for it?? Was her love for Oro just payback for Grim’s betrayal???? Honestly I just don’t care enough to read the next one. It’s going to be a bad love triangle and honestly I just wanted a slow burn romance with a morally gray guy but no she goes for the powerful sun king. SHE HAS FUCKING HISTORY WITH GRIM.

Who knows the random new characters that don’t have any real relevancy in the book?? Then don’t even get me started on how annoying Nina is. She’s is clearly privileged and yes she has some family drama and her mom sucks, but she refuses to hear people out and her relationships with everyone is hot and cold. “My brother and I never got along” to “as long as my brother and father approve of my bf” like what??? Or “I only really knew her bc she was dating my brother” to “she’s one of my closest friends.” Or “my best friend Elizabeth” but not her maid of honor and kinda salty about it??? And the most infuriating relationship is Nina and Nick. There was so many opportunities to have moments between them that were missed. “We went for a hike and had some good conversation” should be a scene that’s written out and developed. Readers want to see the dialogue and the inside moments of these charactes’ relationship. And she’s all like “I love Nick” but then won’t hear him out?? Also the very premise of the book felt like it was missing something. Nina asks Nick to do the fake dating, he says no, then the next page is them packing their bags on a private jet to do the fake dating??? There’s just so much missing from this book like clearly marking when there’s a flashback to clearly marking who’s talking and overall the characters are inconsistent and annoying. Okay part two. I have no reason to root for Nina and Nick they hardly interact in the book. And then Nina’s random relationship that was maybe illegal bc she was a minor pops up out of nowhere?? And her father dies? There was just so many events in this book and not enough details about those events. I want the scene of Nina and Nick running together and them bantering. I don’t want “we came back from a run out of breath from laughing.” The storyline like 45% through stopped making any sense. Her mom was fucking her ex boyfriend (that ex boyfriend had also cheated on Nina with Nina’s ex best friend).

Idk. So I was able to grasp some of the depth. Like not using quotations probably elevated some of the “which is dialogue and which is thought” thinking which is relevant to the title being Conversations with Friends. And I definitely think at the characters were complex but I didn’t like any of them. Nick was using Frances and a cheater. Frances was self destructive and seemingly failed to connect with other people and didn’t even feel like a main or real character until the end bc she was so passive in book. Like she was observant sure but often she wouldn’t actually say shirt. Melissa was a bitch who cheated on her husband while he was in a psychiatric hospital and then got upset when he cheated on her back when they weren’t really in a true marriage (but she was more mad at Frances who ig helped Nick be a better husband in the first place). Bobbi kept abandoning her best friend (not that Frances made it easy to stay) but none of these characters are good people. Ok ok and I get that no one can be perfectly moral or good but that doesn’t mean that you should act like morality doesn’t matter. They were all pretentious in their idiotic conversations about philosophy and other champagne problems but also SO privileged. Regardless of the circumstances why not TRY to be a good person it doesn’t seem like it should be hard. Make mistakes but learn and change your behavior. And the book doesn’t have any real resolution. Like Nick is probably going to back to cheating on Melissa with Frances. Frances will be upset he’s married. Melissa will be mad that she’s being replaced by a twenty one year old. Bobbi will be mad at Frances for something. Frances will be lowkey dying/dealing with her chronic pain but not doing anything to get help. And this book tries soooo hard to be an AP Lit book. Like I just feel it being on the booklist in 2045.

Paul is fighting his demons from being splintered and has basically decided he and Marguerite are no good for one another. As evil Marge or Wicked as OG Marguerite dubs her (Berkeleyverse is OG) attempts to destroy dimensions and kill the Marguerites there, Paul is able to somehow combat the science and stabilize dimensions. Okay and spy Theo from Triadverse kills Egyptverse Marguerite (Berkleyverse hops out before dying) but he is somewhat redeemable bc he ends up sacrificing himself (he hated himself for killing Marguerite) to destroy Triadverse Conley (honestly the Home Office and Triadverse Conley’s are the main villains). Basically, the dimensions start working together and then they are ultimately able to defeat the Home Office verse that was trying to resurrect Josie. They were able to have a conference of Marguerites because one dimension made clones (the Cloneverse) which was great (Paul easily identified each Marguerite), there was also a dimension where Marguerite was deaf and her and Paul already had a baby (also super cute). Marguerite was able to convince her parents to stop the search for Josie (they’d named the project “Project Eurydice” and I just really love that for some reason). Her parents from home office decide to seal their dimension to atone and fix Conley’s trap to destroy all of the worlds (basically he built a fail safe to bring back Josie, but Berkeleyverse Marguerite destroys the body…too). Anyways Marguerite has nothing to lose bc Paul dies in the body of Home Office Paul so after returning home (she had taken over Wicked’s body without Wicked’s conscious in it). She jumps back into her body that wicked had taken over while she had taken over Wicked’s (it’s super complicated) so Wicked is doing bad stuff to Berkeleyverse Theo and Berkeleyverse Josie in Berkeleyverse Marguerite’s body and then jumps out (to not get trapped there? I think the nightthief drug was wearing off or she was just waiting for Berkeleyverse Marguerite to come back) and they try to think of a way to save the Home Office from exploding (sealing the dimension has a 40% chance of collapsing the dimension undoing everything including influencing other dimensions—basically undoing the whole fucking trilogy) but then Wicked comes back and tries to destroy Berkeleyverse for good and then I guess hops back into her dimension? Just to be sealed? Idk. So Berkeleyverse is about to be destroyed but plot twist Paul is not dead and he and Marguerite put their firebirds together to save the universe, declare their love for one another, and that’s kinda the end. So like it was somewhat anticlimactic in ways, but after that second book I don’t think it could be topped. Oh and the home office does not explode so the whole trilogy was not unraveled. I’m kinda sad the trilogy is over but I also can’t think of anything else that could even happen", "authors": "Claudia Gray", "date_read": "2025-09-04"}, {"title": "When Grumpy Met Sunshine", "rating": 8.0, "review": "How fun and cute!
